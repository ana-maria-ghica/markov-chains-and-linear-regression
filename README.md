## Numerical Methods project  
Two key subjects: Markov Chains and Linear Regression - the usage of matrices, linear systems, several optimization algorithms  

## Project structure  
`Task 1`  
-Adjacency matrices, connectivity matrices  
-Linear ecuations systems  
-Heuristic Greedy  
-Encoding the labyrinth  

`Task 2`  
-Optimization algorithms  
-Regularization (Lasso & Ridge)  
-CSV Format files  
  
## Running the checker  
-Through Docker  
Use `./local.sh checker` to build the image and run the checker. This will take
some time (~700 secons). In order to build the image and get output, you can
do `./local.sh docker build` and then run the checker with `./local.sh checker`.  
  
-Manually  
Go to the `checker` directory and run the `./checker.sh` script.
